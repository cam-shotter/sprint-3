What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? 

Depending on what classes you've added Skeleton changes the layout to a mobile type layout, one section directly below the next. It's designed as a mobile first framework which unless a media query is added (eg at 550px) the css will be set by the developer.
